# MoodMirror
Introducing MoodMirror â€” a gentle mood tracker that transforms your week of emotions into a dreamy AI painting ðŸŽ¨
Mental health tools often feel clinical or overwhelming. I wanted to build something softer â€” something that quietly listens, never judges, and even adds a little magic. 
With MoodMirror:
 âœ… You journal one line a day and choose your mood
 ðŸ§  After 7 entries, it summarizes how your week felt
 ðŸŽ¨ Then it creates a custom AI painting inspired by your emotions
 ðŸŽ® A stress hub with games and relaxing videos is available to relieve your mental fatigue.
